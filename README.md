# international_suicid_study
This is a study of the suicide rates of countries in the world, a project of my study at BrainStation.
Three nations are studied as typical: South Afirca (lowest suicide rate per capita), 
Lithuanina (highest suicide rate per capita), and Canada (researcher's home nation).
Due to complicity of the case as a socical behaviour, linear regression is used to extract the most singnificant 
factors of suicide rate. We hope the conclusion of the study will help governments install feasible social
policies to reduce suicide rates in the nations.
